Advisor:
+ how long we could afford to wait for a solution? <=15 mins
+ the number of hotels/hotels_area: 1000
+ the number of bookings 10,000

1000 bookings
hotels: could be 1000, mostly 300
hotel_areas: 20 (hotels within one hotels areas are close)
hotel_areas: 20 30,..., 


1 IP integer programming
2 local search
	+ intractable
	+ but it can reach very good performance
+ connectivity s1 --> local --> 
+ force the solution cost to decrease
+ c++ python(numpy itertool.product)
